# Local Node.js Development Environment

This repository contains configuration for the local development of a Node.js website.

## Docker

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) locally. If running Windows, switch the Docker configuration to use Linux containers. Then in the project root folder, run `docker-compose up`. This will download and run the containers.

Upon completion, you will be able to access the following pages:

- Web at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
- Database Admin at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
- Mail at [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/)
